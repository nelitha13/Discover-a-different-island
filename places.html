                <p>The mountain is located in the southern reaches of the Central Highlands, in the Ratnapura District
                    and Nuwara Eliya district of the Sabaragamuwa Province and Central Province —lying about 40 km
                    northeast of the city of Ratnapura and 32 km southwest of the city of Hatton. The surrounding region
                    is largely forested hills, with no mountain of comparable size nearby. The region along the mountain
                    is a wildlife reserve, housing many species and endemic species. Most local people believe dwarf
                    elephants (kuru ali) live in this samanala forest. <br><br>
                    Adam's Peak is important as a watershed. The districts to the south and the east of Adam's Peak
                    yield precious stones—emeralds, rubies and sapphires, for which the island has been famous, and
                    which earned for its ancient name of Ratnadvipa.<br><br>
                    The peak pilgrimage season is in April, and the goal is to be on top of the mountain at sunrise,
                    when the distinctive shape of the mountain casts a triangular shadow on the surrounding plain and
                    can be seen to move quickly downward as the sun rises.<br><br>
                    Climbing at night can be a remarkable experience, with the lights of the path leading up and into
                    the stars overhead. There are rest stops along the way.<br><br>
                    The mountain is most often scaled from December to May. During other months it is hard to climb the
                    mountain due to very heavy rain, extreme wind, and thick mist.<br><br>
                    For Buddhists, the footprint mark is the left foot of the Buddha, left behind when Buddha visited
                    Sri Lanka, as a symbol for worship at the invitation of Buddhist God Saman.<br><br>
                    Access to the mountain is possible by 6 trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni,
                    Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte & Malimboda. The Nallathanni & Palabaddala routes are most
                    favored by those undertaking the climb, while the Kuruwita-Erathna trail is used less often; these
                    trails are linked to major cities or town by bus, accounting for their popular use.<br><br>
                    The Murraywatte, Mookuwatte & Malimboda routes are hardly used, but do intersect with the
                    Palabaddala road midway through the ascent.<br><br>
                    The usual route taken by most pilgrims is ascent via Hatton and descent via Ratnapura; although the
                    Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also shorter than any of the other trails by approximately five
                    kilometers.<br><br>
                    Sri pada season begin in December and it is end in May. The January to March period is particularly
                    busy time to climb.<br><br>
                    Most people starting this journey Dalhousie call nallathanni. nallathanni is 3 hours from
                    hatton.<br><br>
                    <li>Buses- In peak season might be two direct buses from kandy. Otherwise exists local bus from
                        Hatton. You might be required to change bus in Maskeliya (after around 1.5 hours).
                    </li>
                    <li>Train- The nearest train station is Hatton. Then switch to bus, taxi, tuktuk.</li>
                    <li>Taxi- Depending on your negotiation skills, a taxi (7 seats) around LKR2000-3000.</li>
                    <li>TukTuk- Depending on your negotiation skills. Around LKR600.

                <p>T Bundala harbors 197 species of birds, the highlight being the greater flamingo, which migrate in
                    large flocks. Bundala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1969 and redefined to a national park
                    on 4 January 1993. In 1991 Bundala became the first wetland to be declared as a Ramsar site in Sri
                    Lanka. In 2005 the national park was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, the fourth
                    biosphere reserve in Sri Lanka. The national park is situated 245 kilometers (152 mi) southeast of
                    Colombo.
                    Best time to visit is September to March: during this period, migratory birds arrive at the park.
                    The ecological areas of the national park contain seven terrestrial habitat types and six wetland
                    types. A total of 383 plant species belonging to 90 families have been recorded from the park. In
                    the small degraded patch of mangrove found at the Bundala lagoon area, black mangrove trees are
                    widespread. The strip of Palu (Manilkara hexandra) tree forest on the sand-dunes east of Bundala
                    village is a unique type of forest in Sri Lanka. The Bundala National Park has been identified as an

                Located in central Sri Lanka, the Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple is a living Buddhist site that is focused
                on a series of five cave shrines. Inhabited by forest-dwelling Buddhist monks since the 3rd century BCE,
                these natural caves have been transformed continuously throughout the historical period into one of the
                largest and most outstanding Buddhist complexes in the Southern and South Eastern Asian region,
                showcasing innovative approaches to interior layout and decoration. In keeping with a longstanding
                tradition associated with living Buddhist ritual practices and continuous royal patronage, the cave
                shrines underwent several renovation and refurbishing programmes before assuming their present interior
                forms in the 18th century. The vast internal spaces of the cave shrines are not compartmentalized, but
                are spatially differentiated by a deliberate and subtle arrangement of polychrome sculpture of
                exceptional craftsmanship and decorated with brilliant compositions of mural paintings. This spatial
                hierarchy and purposive interior layout devoid of physical divisions lead the devotees systematically
                through the spaces from one ritual function to the next. The site is remarkable in the Buddhist world
                for its association with the continuous tradition of living Buddhist ritual practices and pilgrimage for
                more than two millennia.

                <p> On one side of cascades, the earth is covered with deciduous plants. Wild animals found in the area
                    include lizards.
                    In Sinhalese, Diyaluma or Diya Haluma means "rapid flow of water" or may be translated as "liquid
                    light". According to Sri Lankan historian, Dr. R. L. Brohier, Diyaluma is the setting of the
                    folklore about a tragedy involving a young chieftain who had been banished to the highlands and the
                    attempt by his betrothed to join. 
                    As all the passes were guarded the young man let down a rope of twisted creepers over the
                    escarpment, as she was hauled up she was dashed against the rocks and died. The Gods, moved to pity
                    by the harrowing spectacle, caused a stream of water to gush from the mountain and veil all evidence
                    of the tragedy in a watery light, hence the term Diyaluma.
                    At 171 m, Diyaluma Ella Falls is the third largest waterfall in Sri Lanka. The torrent of water
                    cascades to the plateau of Koslanda and during the rain, it is a spectacular view.
                    Cascades is located along the Koslanda-Wellawaya road in the district of Badulla. Koslanda is the
                    closest town in the fall, 6 km, and Wellawaya is 13 km.
